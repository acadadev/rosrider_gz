The `rosrider_gz` packages provide the following **simulation environments:**

### üìè Absolute Odometry and TF (world_empty)

This environment uses an **empty world** where **odometry** and the **`tf` (transform)** data are derived directly from the **Gazebo (gz sim) world**. This means the robot's pose is **absolute** and perfectly accurate relative to the simulation origin.

```
ros2 launch rosrider_gz_bringup world_empty.launch.py launch_rviz:=True
```

### üåÄ EKF with Slippery Conditions (world_ekf)

This setup simulates a **slippery world** and relies on an **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** for pose estimation.
It **only uses the `/odom` topic** from the simulation; the simulation **does not** broadcast `/tf` data.
The EKF node actively **listens to `/odom` and `/imu/data`** to calculate and **broadcast the necessary `/tf`** (transform) information.

```
ros2 launch rosrider_gz_bringup world_ekf.launch.py launch_rviz:=True
```

### üî≥ Maze Simulation (Absolute Odometry) (world_maze)

A simulation featuring a **maze environment**. Like the `empty` world, it uses the **absolute coordinates** from the Gazebo world to generate the robot's **odometry and `tf`**, simplifying navigation and localization tasks.

```
ros2 launch rosrider_gz_bringup world_maze.launch.py launch_rviz:=True
```

### üè¢ Willow Mini World (world_willow)

This is a **simplified version of the Willow world**, specifically scaled and configured for **small robots**.
The ground is slippery, and the robot relies solely on encoder odometry and encoder pose for its localization, without using an EKF filter.

```
ros2 launch rosrider_gz_bringup world_willow.launch.py launch_rviz:=True
```

### üåÄ Willow Mini World with EKF (world_willow_ekf)

This is a **simplified version of the Willow world**, specifically scaled and configured for **small robots**.  

The environment features a **slippery ground**, which degrades the accuracy of the robot's raw encoder odometry. 
To compensate, this world relies on an `Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)` for robust pose estimation. 
The EKF node actively fuses the degraded `/odom` topic (the sole odometry source from the simulation) 
with the `/imu/data` (Inertial Measurement Unit) to **calculate and broadcast** the necessary `/tf` (transform) information,
significantly improving localization accuracy over the simple odometry alone.

```
ros2 launch rosrider_gz_bringup world_willow_ekf.launch.py launch_rviz:=True
```

### üåï Moon Simulation with Explorer R2 (world_moon)

Experience a simulation of a **Moon environment** featuring the **Explorer R2 Robot**. üöÄ

```
ros2 launch rosrider_gz_bringup world_moon.launch.py launch_rviz:=True
```

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è Cappadocia Simulation with Husky (world_cappa)

Explore a **Cappadocia-themed world** with the **Husky Robot**.

```
ros2 launch rosrider_gz_bringup world_cappa.launch.py launch_rviz:=True
```
